|                                                                              |
| By game start there only an stack of card displayed and you must press the   |
| "Distribute cards" Button so that the machine mix the cards and distribute   |
| it to the player and to the computer so that everyone get his fives start    |
| cards.                                                                       |
|                                                                              |

| what cards you get in hand. You can press the left mouse key by holding      |
| the mouse over an card to return it an discover what cards you get.          |

| throw card frame at the middle-right from the playground.                    |

| Note that you can exchange the place of your cards if you want, so you can   |
| order it as you like, even move it into an emtpy frame. To get a better      |
| view of your hand.                                                           |
|                                                                              |

| adversary, can throw the cards he doesn't want to keep. The cards of the     |
| computer are covered so that you cannot sea what the computer get in hand,   |
| until the round end and the cards combination comparison.                    |
|                                                                              |

| the computer get in hand or seeing.                                          |
|                                                                              |

| all the settings for a new round.                                            |
|                                                                              |
| You are ready for a new round: press the "Distribute cards" button to        |

|                                                                              |
| CPoker follow the cards combination hierarchy according to the poker rules:  |
|                                                                              |
|  From the highest to the lowest combination:                                 |
|                                                                              |
|  1) ROYAL QUINTE FLUSH                                                       |
|     5 following cards values ending with an Ace from the same color (Diamond,|
|     Heart, Spade, Club).                                                     |
|     if the two players get an ROYAL QUINTE FLUSH there is an egality.        |
|     No color have precedence on another.                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  2) QUINTE FLUSH                                                             |
|     5 following cards values not ending with an Ace from the same color      |
|     (Diamond , Heart, Spade, Club).                                          |
|     if the two players get an QUINTE FLUSH the highest card decide which is  |
|     the winner. If the tow players get the same QUINTE FLUSH in different    |
|     colors (Diamond , Heart, Spade, Club) they are at egality.               |
|     No color have precedence on another.                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  3) FOUR                                                                     |
|     4 same cards from the same value.                                        |
|     It's impossible that the 2 players get the same four at the same time    |
|     in an 32 cards game (from 7 to Ace). CPocker use a 32 cards game.        |
|                                                                              |
|  4) FULL HOUSE                                                               |
|     3 same cards from the same value (an BRELAN) and 2 same cards from the   |
|     same value (an PAIR).                                                    |
|     Egality is not possible with an 32 cards games, because for comparing    |
|     2 FULL HOUSE we must compare the BRELAN values which cannot be the same  |
|     in an 32 cards game (from 7 to Ace).                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  5) COLOR                                                                    |
|     5 cards from the same color.                                             |
|     In case the two players get a COLOR there are egality.                   |
|     No color have precedence on another.                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  6) QUINTE                                                                   |
|     5 following cards values from different colors.                          |
|     In case the two players get a QUINTE the value of the highest card       |
|     decide which is the winner.                                              |
|     If the highest card is the same by the two players there is egality.     |
|     No color have precedence on another.                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  7) BRELAN                                                                   |
|     3 same cards from the same value.                                        |
|     If the two players get an brelan the highest BRELAN decide which is the  |
|     winner.                                                                  |
|     It's impossible that the two players get the same BRELAN at the same     |
|     time in an 32 cards game (from 7 to Ace).                                |
|                                                                              |
|  8) TWO PAIRS                                                                |
|     2 times 2 sames cards from the same value.                               |
|     In case the two players get TWO PAIRS the highest value pair is compared |
|     and the highest value decide which is the winner. In case the highest    |
|     pair is from the same value we compare the lowest value pair to decide   |
|     which is the winner.                                                     |
|     In case the 2 players get exactly the same TWO PAIRS combination we      |
|     compare the value of the resting card to decide which is the winner.     |
|                                                                              |
|  9) PAIR                                                                     |
|     2 same cards from the same value.                                        |
|     In case the tow players get the same value pair we compare the highest   |
|     resting card to decide which is the winner. If a winner cannot be found  |
|     there is an egality.                                                     |
|                                                                              |
|  10) NOTHING                                                                 |
|      No one of the combination. To decide which is the winner we compare the |
|      cards and the highest card decide which is the winner.                  |
|      If no winner is found there is an egality.                              |
|                                                                              |

| I implement this game by taking care at the respect of the player in sense   |
| that the computer doesn't not never know what you get in hand before         |
| comparing to take advantage of it for computing what cards the computer      |
| will throw. And the computer doesn't know which cards are coming next from   |
| the distributing heap to cash in on.                                         |
|                                                                              |

| -) Respect of the cards distributing order which is inverted every round.    |
|                                                                              |
| -) To set the throwed cards under the heap after gathering it all after a    |
|    round.                                                                    |
|                                                                              |
| By assured that the game is honest with the player.                          |
